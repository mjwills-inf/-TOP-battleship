Outstanding errors/bugs:
- Occasionally computer doesnt take turn after having spammed click. No error in console. Cannot get behaviour to happen intentionally.
- Drag and Drop API seems to allow you to start a drag when spamming click, even though the element is set as draggable="false", and has no event listener on it. Console shows associated errors with applying functions from dragstart to it.
